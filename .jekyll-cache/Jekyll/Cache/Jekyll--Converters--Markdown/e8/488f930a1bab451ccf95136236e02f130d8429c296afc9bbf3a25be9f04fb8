I"<p>Welcome friends, family, and followers!<br />
This project has been a long time coming since I began my transition to a working artist in early 2019. Now here we are nearly a year later and I am incredibly pleased to finally have a professional platform to display my work. A massive thank you to everyone who has supported me in my artistic endeavors thus far, and a warm welcome to those of you who are new to my journey. My parents like to say that Iâ€™ve always been their little artist, with my mom proudly hanging my first paintings from 2 years old on and my dad boasting that it's all thanks to his artistic genes. It was from their love and support that I have always had the opportunity to grow my passion. Before I could form my own thoughts I was painting and I hope to continue long after my memories have left me, I hope youâ€™ll join in my adventure by following me on social media or -even better- making a purchase to help me fulfill my calling. <br />


Cheers to the new year!
