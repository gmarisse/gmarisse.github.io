<p>Gabriella Betance is a 20 year old self-taught painter from Boulder Colorado inspired since early childhood to create art which reflects the beauty of the world around her. Working in vivid colors and meticulous brushwork she pulls the viewer into her classical landscapes, intimate portraiture, and many charming subjects of the natural and animal world. With parents actively engaged in small town art communities, Gabriella grew up inspired by the work of local artists, often visiting galleries of family friends and art museums. Constantly enrolled in a mix of private and public art courses throughout her time in school, it wasnâ€™t until a post graduation transitional year that she fully surrendered to her artistic calling. Now working 9-5 and saving diligently to further her art education, Gabriella spends her personal days studying art history, exploring new techniques, and building her dream portfolio.</p>
